    <h1> <strong><em>FAVORITE BAND</em></strong></h1>
    <p>
        Music eases one's mind and it soothes one heart. Music plays a big role in our lives. 
        Though some may listen to music and get entertained,some will get a message from it. Yes, music <strong>conveys</strong> messages.
         <strong><em>H_art the band</em></strong> is my favorite band because it has got a different type of taste unlike the rest. Their music is inspiring.The <em>stage performance</em> and their <em>dressing code</em> is always outstanding. The hair style which is <em>locs</em> are at per with the kind of tune they make which is reggae hence blends with what they deliver.

     Just as the name (<strong>ART</strong>) suggests, the three men try so hard to make their audience happy with what they deliver. The band was formed in 2012 when they met at <em>KNT</em> during a play on Cancer Awareness. It was during the auditions that Mordecai sang and both Kenneth and Wachira knew that they could sing. They later came together and formed their band which was later signed by the <em>Penya Africa.</em>  The three are;
